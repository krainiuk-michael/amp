# AMP 8.3 Demo


This is a demo project to illustrate how the [AMP 8.3](https://www.drupal.org/project/amp) module works.

The demo was created from a [Github repository](https://github.com/karens/amp), and [TugboatQA](https://tugboat.qa) is used to preview the demo site. You can view this demo in Tugboat, or fork this demo repository to own working demo site where you can add, edit, and change anything you like.

To create your own demo site:

- Fork or clone the [demo repository](https://github.com/karens/amp) to create your own Github repository with a copy of this code.
- Sign up for a free [TugboatQA](https://tugboat.qa) account.
- Create a Tugboat project, like 'AMP Demo'.
- When asked for a repository for the project, select your own Github repository.
- Once the repository is linked, click the 'Preview' button on Tugboat to build a complete working demo web site (it will take a few minutes to build). Log into your demo with username 'admin' and password 'admin' (change the password after you log in).

You might want to check out [the documentation on wiring up Tugboat to Drupal 8](https://docs.tugboat.qa/examples/drupal8/),
and the [Tugboat configuration](https://github.com/karens/schema_metatag_demo8/blob/master/.tugboat)
to see how this project is configured to work with Tugboat.
